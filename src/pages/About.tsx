          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            31-year-old Californian Korean American. I started my journey as a highly gifted magnet student.
            I went to UC Berkeley studying Computer Science, then dropped out to chase my dreams in
            professional esports. After years of competing at the highest level in League of
            Legends, I returned to software engineering to experience the corporate side of the world.
            I took a break to focus on my mental and physical health and to travel the world. 
            I'm now looking to get back into work and build innovative cool products.

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            My goal is to learn and stay knowledgeable about the world and its advances in technology. 
            I want to living a balanced and fulfilling life, while aiming to be the best at whatever I pursue.
            I'm very competitive and driven. I love sharing ideas and teaching others and just in general, being a good friend.

          <h2>Passion</h2>
          <p>
            Competitive gaming shaped who I amâ€”it taught me strategic thinking, rapid
            decision-making, and how to perform under pressure. Today, I channel that same
            intensity into software engineering, building tools and systems to make my life and the others around me a bit easier.
            I'm a big advocate on health and wellness, constantly self-reflecting on how I can make my life 1% better everyday.
